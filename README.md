# Uchide2020GJI
Here, the focal mechanisms determined by Uchide (2020) is available. See Uchide2020_mecalist.txt. The file format is as follows: 
* Column  1: Year of the origin time in Japan Standard Time (JST=UTC+9)
* Column  2: Month
* Column  3: Day
* Column  4: Hour
* Column  5: Minute
* Column  6: Second
* Column  7: Latitude of the hypocenter
* Column  8: Longitude
* Column  9: Depth (km)
* Column 10: Magnitude (JMA magnitude)
* Column 11: Strike (deg.) of one of nodal planes
* Column 12: Dip (deg.)
* Column 13: Rake (deg.)
* Column 14: Rank (quality) of the solution given by the HASH code.
* Column 15: Number of stations used for the focal mechanism determination.
